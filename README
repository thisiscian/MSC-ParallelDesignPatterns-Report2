-----------------
 actor_metaphor
-----------------

This is an library implementation of the actor model in C using MPI.
The module MPICH-2 is required to be loaded.
The library is compiled with mpicc, based on the portland group's C compiler, pgcc.
The library can be compiled with 
  
  make library

and can included in a C program with

  #include <actor_metaphor.h>

so long as the the library is linked at compilation time using
  
  -l actor_metaphor -L path_to_actor_library/ -I path_to_actor-library/

as seen in 'frog/Makefile'.

More information can be found in the README file in the 'actor_metaphor/' folder.

------
 frog
------

This is a simulation of frogs with blue-nosed disease.
Use MPICH-2 and mpicc based on pgcc.
It is implemented using the actor_metaphor library.

Compile with

  make frog

and run with

  make run

More information, including command line arguments, can be found in the README file in the 'frog/' folder, or by running

  ./frog/frog_exec --help 

--------------------------------
 Running on Multiple Processors 
--------------------------------

Locally, this can be done with 

  make local-N

where N is the number of processors required.
Submission to Morar can also be achieved using

  make submit-N

which will submit the job with N request processors.
For greater flexibility, use

  ./qsubmit N ARGS

where N is the number of processors, and ARGS are arguments that the frog implementation can take.
These are documented in the README file in the 'frog/' folder.
