The frog model frog_exec has several command line arguments that can be used to modify it

  --frog N
    defines the total number of frogs
  --max-frog N
    defines the maximum number of frogs the simulation can run
  --disease N
    defines the number of diseased frogs
  --cell N
    defines the number of land cells (numbers not equal to 16 will give erratic movements)
  --max-year N
    defines the number of years to run the simulation for
  --year-length F
    defines the the length of time that each year takes (can have decimals)
  --buffer-size F
    defines the size of the buffer used by MPI in MB (can have decimals).
      Use this if the program is running out of memory.
  --help
    shows the help message

Currently the frog_metaphor only balances load across processors with a land cell on them.
This means that the number of useful processors is limited to the number of land cells.
This is compounded by the fact that the system currently has no method of assigning actors to unused processors.
