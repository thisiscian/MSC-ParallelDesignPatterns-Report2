The frog model frog_exec has several command line arguments that can be used to modify it

  --frog N
    defines the total number of frogs
  --max-frog N
    defines the maximum number of frogs the simulation can run
  --disease N
    defines the number of diseased frogs
  --cell N
    defines the number of land cells (numbers not equal to 16 will give erratic movements)
  --max-year N
    defines the number of years to run the simulation for
  --year-length F
    defines the the length of time that each year takes (can have decimals)
  --buffer-size F
    defines the size of the buffer used by MPI in MB (can have decimals).
      Use this if the program is running out of memory.
  --help
    shows the help message

currently the program crashes if you submit it with more than 8 jobs, for reasons unknown.
The limit should be 15, at which point load balancing fails.
